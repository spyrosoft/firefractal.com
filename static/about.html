			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>Q:</strong> What is this site for?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>A:</strong> Firefractal.com was created with the dream of making it possible for anyone to explore the Mandelbrot Set and print high quality, cost effective fractal posters of their own creation.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q:</strong> If I zoom in really far, the image becomes pixelated. Is this a bug?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>A:</strong> This is a limitation of JavaScript/web browsers. For computer/math people, JavaScript is limited to 64bit floats. An arbitrary precision approach may be implemented in the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Q:</strong> What sets firefractal.com apart from the others?
			</p>
			<strong>A:</strong> The way the Mandelbrot Set is portrayed here is, as far as we know, unique for the following reasons:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Other software tends to use a set range of colors - usually a rainbow so that it overflows to the other end of the spectrum without any additional effort. We intentionally avoided this technique in favor of custom gradient colors. Originally just two, which we still think produces some of the nicest imagery.
				</li>
				<li>
					Other software tends not utilize the entire range of colors available. This is silly. For example, the minimum iteration will often be something like 14. We use an equation to map iterations to <em>all</em> available colors, resulting in more prominent contrast and ultimately more beautiful imagery.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Q:</strong> How many calculations does the computer do to make one image?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>A:</strong> Using a large monitor with high detail, one frame can be around five and a half billion calculations, performed by your browser. Hard to imagine.

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>Fun Fact</strong> - Here is a list of all of the technologies combined together to make this project happen!
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">HTML5</a></strong> makes web developers' lives easier in many ways compared with older standards such as XHTML.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial">Canvas</a></strong> is a two or three dimensional pixel based technology which is built into HTML5. (Pixel based is also known as raster based - as opposed to vector based.) The images you see of the Mandelbrot Set are painted using the &lt;canvas&gt; element.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a></strong> are a technique used to run separate processes to avoid blocking the main JavaScript thread. In a way, they are like AJAX requests to other tabs without the use of the DOM. The images you see of the Mandelbrot Set are generated section by section using web workers.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a></strong> is a tremendously fantastic CSS framework. It is probably the best in existence for mobile-first design. It makes designing and developing websites for all platforms and screen sizes a breeze.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a></strong> is a CSS preprocessor. It is what CSS should have been. It includes variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, operators, etc. All sorts of lovely things! It is a huge time and effort saver.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a></strong> is the most popular JavaScript framework. Foundation depends on jQuery. It isn't necessarily the best from a language design perspective, but its collection of libraries outclasses any other framework.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial">SVG</a></strong> is a vector based image stored as XML. Because SVG images are text files, they are stunningly small. Vector based images also have the advantage of displaying brilliantly on retina displays. Software like Illustrator and Inkscape are natively vector based and can both export images to SVG. The images on the <a href="how-to.html">How To</a> page were written by hand in a text editor. <a href="/images/zoom-in.svg" target="_blank">Take a look at the page source</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://internet.bs">Internet.bs</a></strong> is a domain registrar with very competitive prices and a fairly good user interface.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a></strong> is the open source, stable distribution of Linux in the (commercial) Red Hat family. Stable means it uses the tried and true rather than the very latest (sometimes buggy or vulnerable) versions of software.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a></strong> (short for High Availability Proxy), is server load-balancing software which is very easy to install and configure for small and large scale projects.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/">Hunchentoot</a></strong> is a powerful yet minimal web server as well as web framework. It makes it easy to do things like serve static files (images, css, JavaScript, etc. ) from ram.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/contents.html">Common Lisp</a></strong> is the programming language which Hunchentoot was written in. One of the most amazing things it has the ability to do, in comparison with other languages such as PHP, is make changes to programs WHILE THEY ARE RUNNING. This happens after the code has been compiled and loaded into ram.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects">Quicklisp</a></strong> is the well known package manager for Common Lisp. It makes literally thousands of Common Lisp packages available, most of which are free and open source, and does away with dependency headaches.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a></strong> is a compiled and strictly typed language invented by three (awesome) Google employees. It is lightning fast, and tries to be a friend to the developer as much as possible.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?interface=en">Emacs</a></strong> is an extremely powerful text editor. You may have heard of the Vim/Emacs flame wars. Emacs is particularly well suited for editing Lisp because it was written in it.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="http://ohmyz.sh/">ZSH</a></strong> is Bash with intelligence built in. It streamlines just about everything a sysadmin needs from the command line.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Most websites have a laundry list of technologies of similar length to this one and it takes on the order of 400 man hours to produce this type of project. The software behind the scenes has been through many iterations (JavaScript, C, Processing, Go, Common Lisp, and a ground-up JavaScript rewrite).
