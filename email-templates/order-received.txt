We are extatic that you bought a Fire Fractal poster!

If you are interested, let me tell you the story of how firefractal.com came to be. When I was in high school, a burgeoning programmer, I came across someone's blog post about his experience making a Mandelbrot program for fun. He described how blown away he was by the simplicity of the code. I was equally blown away. Here it is, verbatim, from firefractal.com:

function fractal_ocean_floor( x0, y0 )
{
	var x = 0;
	var y = 0;
	
	var iteration = 0;
	
	while ( x*x + y*y < 4 && iteration < max_iterations )
	{
		var x_temporary = x*x - y*y + x0;
		
		y = 2*x*y + y0;
		
		x = x_temporary;
		
		iteration++;
	}
	
	return iteration;
}
(20 lines)

No kidding. The x0 and y0 are coordinates for each pixel on the screen. The rest of the code (more than 100 times as much) is for the user interface.

Eventually the itch to make my own got me and I wrote version 1.0. It was a bit buggy and hard to use. Years later, after having explored quite a bit, it was time to rewrite it with a (much) better user interface. There are many fractal exploration tools out there. Quite a few of them have features that the others don't. It is our goal that firefractal.com be the combination of all of the best features in one.

We would love to hear from you if you have:
* Feedback about what could be better.
* Any other comments, questions or ideas.
* (Our favorite) An incling to just to say hi!

Hit reply and we'll get your message.

Thank you sincerely,

Fire Fractal
