            is a two or three dimensional pixel based (meaning raster as opposed to vector) technology which is built into HTML5. The fractal images you see are painted using the &lt;canvas&gt; element.

            are a technique used to run separate processes to avoid blocking the main JavaScript thread. In a way, they are like AJAX requests to other tabs without the use of the DOM. The fractal images you see are generated section by section using web workers.

            is a tremendously fantastic CSS framework. It is probably the best in existence. It makes designing and developing websites for all platforms and screen sizes a breeze.

            is a CSS preprocessor. It is what CSS should have been. It includes variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, operators, etc. All sorts of lovely things! It is a huge time and effort saver.

            is the most popular JavaScript framework. Foundation depends on jQuery. It isn't necessarily the best from a computer science perspective, but its community and sheer number of plugins exceeds any other framework by far.

            is a vector based image stored as XML. Because SVG images are text files, they are stunningly small. Vector based images also have the advantage of displaying brilliantly on retina displays. Software like Illustrator and Inkscape are natively vector based and can both export images to SVG. The images on the

          Most websites have a laundry list of technologies of similar length to this one and it takes on the order of 400 man hours to produce this type of project. The software behind the scenes has been through many iterations (JavaScript, C, Processing, Go, Common Lisp, and a number of ground-up JavaScript rewrites).
